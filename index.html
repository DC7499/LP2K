==============
<i>"A lan party is a gathering of people with computers or compatible game consoles, where a
local area network LAN connection is established between the devices using a router or switch,
primarily for the purpose of playing multiplayer video games together."</i>

Lan party 2000 takes place in Moscow, we usually gather on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
